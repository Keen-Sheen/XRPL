## The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is a decentralized, public blockchain & a public good
It’s fast, energy efficient, and reliable. With ease of development, low transaction costs, and a knowledgeable community, it provides developers with a strong open-source foundation for executing on the most demanding projects—without hurting the environment. Here are some of the XRPL features:

* Public and Decentralized Structure
* Streamlined Development
* Low Cost
* Proven Reliability
* High Performance
* Vibrant Community


The `xrpl-py` library is a pure Python implementation for interacting with the XRP Ledger, the library simplifies the hardest parts of XRP Ledger interaction, like serialization and transaction signing, by providing native Python methods and models for [XRP Ledger transactions](https://xrpl.org/transaction-formats.html) and core server [API](https://xrpl.org/api-conventions.html) ([`rippled`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled)) objects.
