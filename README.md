A pure Python implementation for interacting with the XRP Ledger, the `xrpl-py` library simplifies the hardest parts of XRP Ledger interaction, like serialization and transaction signing, by providing native Python methods and models for [XRP Ledger transactions](https://xrpl.org/transaction-formats.html) and core server [API](https://xrpl.org/api-conventions.html) ([`rippled`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled)) objects.

This repository focuses on the XRP Ledger and interacting with its functionalties using python programing language. This repository will include:
* Connecting to the XRPL
